# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) working in this
repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — edit here only.

## What this is

Bybit spot ⇄ Fluxion (Mantle) tokenized-stocks (xStocks) live arbitrage panel. Phase-1 WMNT/USDT0 offline backtest is archived under src/mba and report/

The full PRD — requirements, architecture, milestones, rejected alternatives, open
risks — lives in `docs/DESIGN.md`. Read it before making any design or architectural
decision; do not re-derive parameters or decisions that are already validated there.

## Status

<!-- Keep this section current: what has landed, what is architected-for but NOT
implemented yet. Update it the moment reality changes instead of leaving stale
placeholders. Agents must not assume a module exists until its issue lands. -->

- **Phase 1 (archived, tag `phase1-backtest`):** offline WMNT/USDT0 backtest under
  `src/mba/` with delivered reports in `report/`. Pipeline still runs against local
  parquet under `data/`.
- **Phase 2 (active):** Bybit ⇄ Fluxion xStocks live panel. Product decisions are in
  `docs/DESIGN.md`; implementation starts at M1 (WHI-730). Skeleton package:
  `src/monitor/` (added in WHI-736). Do not assume monitor modules exist until their
  issues land.

## Build, test, run

```bash
uv sync                                       # install deps (creates .venv)
uv run pytest                                 # unit tests
uv run ruff check .                           # lint
uv run mypy                                   # type check
# Phase-1 pipeline (needs data/ parquet from a prior run):
uv run python -u -m mba.m5_report             # regenerate report/ from local parquet
# Phase-2 entrypoint lands with M5 (WHI-734); until then there is no live main.
```

## Runtime configuration

Secrets live in `.env` at the repo root (`.env.example` is the checked-in
template), loaded at startup — a missing required var must fail fast with a clear
error. **Never commit `.env`.** Non-secret runtime parameters (thresholds, feature
flags, tunables) live in `config/` as validated, typed config — not hardcoded, not in
`.env`. See `config/README.md` for the convention.

## Architecture

Module layout is fixed by `docs/DESIGN.md` §4.2. Keep this section a short mirror of
that section — one bullet per top-level module, its single responsibility, and the
load-bearing interfaces other modules may depend on.

<!-- Fill in as DESIGN.md §4.2 lands, e.g.:
- **`<module>/`** — responsibility; depends only on <interface>.
-->

## Git workflow (mandatory)

**One issue = one git worktree off latest `origin/dev` = one PR into `dev`.**
Do **not** implement issues in the primary clone working tree.

1. `git fetch` + create worktree/branch from `origin/dev`
   (`fix/whi-NNN-topic` or `feat/whi-NNN-topic`).
   **Check the issue's labels first** — an issue labelled `hotfix` branches off
   `origin/main` instead and targets `main` (see **Promotion lanes** below). Verify the
   base right after creating the worktree — `git merge-base HEAD origin/dev` must equal
   `git rev-parse origin/dev` — whatever tooling created it. *(Runtime aside: Claude
   Code's `EnterWorktree` defaults to `origin/main`, wrong for this lane. Any wrapper may
   have its own default; the check above is what settles it.)*
2. Implement only that issue; tracker state → **`In Progress`**.
3. `gh pr create --base dev` (title/body include `WHI-NNN`); tracker →
   **`In Review`**. Any review finding you intentionally leave unfixed goes in
   `docs/DEFERRED_ISSUES.md` as part of this PR — see that file for the format.
4. A PR whose implementation went through `/implement`'s full three-round review loop
   (plus the escalation pass, when round 3 left findings open) is **pre-authorized to
   self-squash-merge** once it reads MERGEABLE/CLEAN and tests + lint pass — no separate
   human approval. **Exceptions that stop at `In Review` for a human:** changes touching
   **key handling, RPC credentials**, and `release/*` → `main` promotions. PRs that skipped the
   review loop also stop at `In Review`. After merging, run the **post-merge cleanup**
   below.

### Post-merge cleanup (mandatory, in order)

Drive these from the **primary clone**; never commit to `dev` directly.

0. **If the PR is CONFLICTING** (`dev` advanced since you branched): inside the feature
   worktree, `git merge origin/dev`, resolve, rerun the affected tests, and `git push`.
   The PR must read **MERGEABLE / CLEAN** before you merge.
1. **Squash-merge + drop the remote branch:** `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch`.
2. **Remove the worktree:** `git worktree remove <worktree-path>` then
   `git worktree prune`.
3. **Delete the local branch:** `git branch -D fix/whi-NNN-topic`
   (this fails while the worktree still holds the branch — do step 2 first).
4. **Fast-forward local `dev`:** `git fetch origin --prune` then
   `git merge --ff-only origin/dev` (must fast-forward — do not create commits on
   `dev`).
5. **Tracker → `Done`.**

### Promotion lanes (`→ main`)

`main` **equals production** — always the last deployed tag. Never open a PR with `dev` as
head into `main` (the branch would be auto-deleted by `delete_branch_on_merge`). Two lanes
reach `main`, and picking the wrong one ships unreviewed work:

- **Release** — everything on `dev` is shippable. Cut a temporary `release/vX.Y.Z` from
  `dev`, PR → `main`. **Always a human gate.**
- **Hotfix** — production is broken *and* `dev` holds work that must not ship. Branch off
  `origin/main`, PR → `main`, then **merge `main` back into `dev`** or the next release
  re-ships the bug.

The decision rule: run `git log --oneline origin/main..origin/dev`. **If that list holds a
single commit you would not ship right now, you must use the hotfix lane.**

Merge strategy is per-lane: **squash** into `dev`, but **merge commit** into `main` —
squashing a release/hotfix disconnects the tag from `dev`'s history and silently breaks
`git log <tag>..origin/dev`. Bump the project version before tagging, **deploy from the
tag and never from a branch**, and keep the tracker Release ↔ git tag ↔ GitHub Release
triple in agreement (backfill the Release's `commitSha`).

Enable the local push guard once per clone **and per worktree**:
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

Full rules: `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`.

## Template feedback loop

This repo was bootstrapped from the shared project template
(`https://github.com/Whisker17/code-template`). When work here surfaces an improvement that belongs to the
**template layer** — a workflow rule that bit us, a skills configuration fix, a doc
convention worth standardizing — tell the user explicitly so they can port it back to
the template repo (and its `CHANGELOG.md`). Project-specific learnings stay here;
process-level learnings flow back.

## Agent runtime (any agent, any vendor)

This repo is runtime-neutral: Claude Code, Codex, or anything else. Nothing in the
workflow names a model. Instead, skills name a **role** — `REVIEWER`, `ESCALATOR`,
`EXPLORER` — mapped to real commands in `config/agent-roles.conf` and dispatched through
`scripts/agent-dispatch.sh`. Full contract: **`docs/agents/runtime.md`**.

Two rules matter more than the mechanism:

- **Review happens in a different context than implementation**, with a model at least as
  capable (cross-vendor preferred). Check the path before relying on it:
  `scripts/agent-dispatch.sh --probe`.
- **If the reviewer is unavailable, the review loop did not run** — finish the work, open
  the PR, and stop at `In Review` for a human. Self-review in the implementing context
  never authorizes a self-merge.

When a model generation turns over, edit `config/agent-roles.conf` and nothing else.

## Agent skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Runtimes that auto-discover them expose
each as `/<name>`; **in a runtime with no skill loader, read the file directly** — a skill
is just markdown. The load-bearing ones:

| Skill | Path |
|-------|------|
| `/implement` | `.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` |
| `/code-review` | `.claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` |
| `/grill-me` → `/to-spec` → `/to-tickets` | `.claude/skills/{grill-me,to-spec,to-tickets}/SKILL.md` |
| `/tdd`, `/diagnosing-bugs`, `/handoff`, `/triage` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `/ask-matt` (which skill do I want?) | `.claude/skills/ask-matt/SKILL.md` |

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live in **Linear** (project `Mantle <> Bybit Arbitrage Monitor`, team
`Whisker-Personal`). Access is a fallback ladder — MCP tools, else the GraphQL API with
`LINEAR_API_KEY` — and reaching the tracker is mandatory, not optional: workflow state
moves in lockstep with the PR. External PRs are not a triage surface. See
`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical role names (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`,
`ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) used verbatim as Linear labels. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This repo's spec of record is `docs/DESIGN.md` (PRD: requirements, architecture,
milestones, rejected alternatives, open risks) plus `docs/adr/` for narrower decisions
made after v1 ships. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
